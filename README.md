# PB&J Time Sandwitch Builder React App

### Link to deployed app: https://sandwitch-builder.vercel.app/

### Objective
The objective of this project was to gain experience building web apps in React from scratch. I created a sandwitch builder app that lets you add ingrediants and make your own sandwitch. The app comes with sort and filter features to filter though items (nut butters, jams, toppings, savory, sweet). 

### Running the App Locally
1. Download the repository and open it in VSCode. 
2. In the terminal, use the command "npm start" to launch the webapp. 
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the site. 


### Bugs/Errors
As of now, there are no known bugs in the code, and I tried to fix them all the best I could. If there are any ways to improve the usability or UX of the site, let me know!
